- The vast amount of data manipulation in our apps happens through asynchronous channels.
- Vanilla Redux isn't set up to handle asynchronous out of the box.

- The propose of Redux Thunk is to give us direct control over the dispatch method.
Dispatch is a method inside redux store that contains the app state.

- You use dispatch under the hood on any vanilla redux app:
Dispatch filters the actions and the remainder operations ie:
React -> action creator -> action -> Dispatch [Middleware -> Reducers -> State ] -> React
