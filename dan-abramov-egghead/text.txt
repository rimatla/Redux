- Redux Represents the whole state of an app as a single JS object.
- State Tree is read only, we cant write to it or modify it.

- To change the state you need to dispacth an action

- An action is a plain js object `describing` the state change
- Only req is that it had at least a type
type: ""; 
- strings types are suggested for serialization 

- Pure function are functions whose `return value` depends solely on the values of its arguments.

- Reducer is a pure function:
 1- takes the prev app state, 
 2- the action being dispatched 
 3- retuns the next app state
