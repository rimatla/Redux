# Redux 
#### I- Action creators are functions that create and return actions.
#### II- Thunks: are higher order functions that give you control over when and how often the actions are dispatched (asynchronicity)
#### Thunks allow us to write robust action creators that are asynchronous.
#### III - Suggestions (built an express server to suggest new names)
#### IV-  isomorphic fetch: (AJAX calls)
#### Isomorphic fetch library returns a promise. That means that we can wait for an asynchronous response.
